I go to loud places
To search got someone
To be quiet with
Who will take me home
You go to loud places
To find someone who
Will take toy higher than
I took you
Didn't I take you to
Higher places you can't reach without me?
(I have never reached such heights) Reach without me
(I feel music in your eyes)
(I have never reached such heights)
