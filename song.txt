I go to loud places
To search got someone
To be quiet with
Who will take me home
You go to loud places
To find someone who
Will take toy higher than
I took you
Didn't I take you to
Higher places you can't reach without me?
(I have never reached such heights) Reach without me
(I feel music in your eyes)
(I have never reached such heights)
I go to those places
Where we used to go
They seem so quiet now
I'm here, all alone
You go to new places
With I don't know who
And I don't know how
To follow you
Higher, I take you higher and I'll take you, didn't I take you higher?
I take you higher, I take you higher and I take you
Didn't I take you higher? I take you
